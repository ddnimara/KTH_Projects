# KTH_Projects
Here lie my coding adventures during my Graduate programme in Machine Learning at KTH.

In general, this repository will hold a subset of programming tasks which I deemed interesting, yet
not large enough to hold their own separate repository. I will try to keep it updated throughout my 
M.Sc. in Machine Learning at KTH.
