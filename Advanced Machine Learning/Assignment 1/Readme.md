# Assignment 1 of Advanced Machine Learning

This file includes two main pdfs. One containing the general information and question, and one containing my Answers.

This Assignments covers a broad range of definitions and Machine Learning entinties, focusing on the Gaussian Learning Approach, such as:
- [Linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) and Non-Parametric Regression (based on kernels).
- Point Estimates of Parameteres utilizing [Maximum Likelihood (ML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation)
  and [Maximum a Posteriori (MAP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_a_posteriori_estimation).
- Bayesian approach to parameter learning which consists of **marginalization** the parameter out of the distribution (e.g. [type two 
  maximum likelihood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_likelihood)).
- Simple [Graphical Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model).
- [Gaussian Processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_process).
- [Representation Learning](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~cvrg/hilary2006/ppca.pdf) (Factor Analysis, Probabilistic PCA).
- [Bayesian interpretation](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/papers/05occam/occam.pdf) of [Occam's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor).

Overall, the assignment covers a wide spectrum of Bayesian Notions and I hope it will be as helpful to the reader, as it was to me.
