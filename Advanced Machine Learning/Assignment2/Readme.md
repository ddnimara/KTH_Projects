#Assignment 1 of Advanced Machine Learning

This file includes two main pdfs. One containing the general information and questions, and one containing my Answers.

This Assignment builds on the previous one, by examining equally pivotal Machine Learning notions that revolve around Graphical Models:
- [Bayesian Network Inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model) to determinte Mutual Random Variable Dependencies.
- Parameter Estimation utilizing [EM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm) algorithm.
- Parameter Estimation utilizing [Variational Inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_Bayesian_methods).
- Application of said algorithms on complex Graphical models, such as Hidden Markov Models, Gausian Mixtures and Tree Mixture Models
(with varying Priors).
- [Ancestral Sampling](https://ermongroup.github.io/cs228-notes/inference/sampling/) on intricate tree induced distrubution.

Overall, the assignment covers a wide spectrum of Bayesian Graphical Model Notions and I hope it will be as helpful to the reader, 
as it was to me.
